Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both
Wee, sleeket, cowran, tim’rous beastie, O, what a panic’s in thy breastie!
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weather’d every rack,
Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice.
I can't seem to face up to the facts. I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax. I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire.
